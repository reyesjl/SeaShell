============================================

0.  This is a shell I wrote in C, hence it's name, Sea Shell. It's 
    implementation consists of 3 parts. 
    
    1 - The Parser
    2 - The Executer
    3 - The Shell Subsystems

============================================

## 1.  The Parser

    Reads the input from command line, and passes them into a struct
    called a command table. The command table has eah command the 
    user entered, as well as any arguments passed to that argument. 

    Example:

    >$ ls -al | grep me 
    
    Command Table
    +---------+-----------+----------+-----+
    | ls      | -al       | aab      | aaa |
    +---------+-----------+----------+-----+
    | grep    | me        |          |     |
    +---------+-----------+----------+-----+
    | In:dflt | Out:file1 | Err:dflt |     |
    +---------+-----------+----------+-----+

    The way the parser does this is using the Lex which is a Lexical
    Analyzer Generator which is used by many compilers to process 
    input streams such as the ones we will be getting from our users.
    Lex divides the line into tokens which are processed by the parser.

============================================

## 2.  The Executer

    Takes each simple command in the command table generated by the
    parser and forks a new process to run it. Very beautifully, it
    also creates necessary pipes between processes, and handles
    redirections.

    Example:

    >$ A | B | C | D < infile > outfile

    i.      A reads in from 'infile'
    ii.     passes it's output to B's input
    iii.    B passes it's output to C's input
    iv.     C does the same to D
    v.      Finally D's output goes to the 'outfile'

============================================

## 3.  The Shell Subsystems

    To enable environment variables, wildcards, and subsystems 
    between backticks.

    Example: 

    Environment variables
    >$ ${VAR}

    Wildcards
    >$ javac *.java 

    Subsystems
    >$ `awk -F: '{print $6}'
